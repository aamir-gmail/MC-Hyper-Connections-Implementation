Project Title: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) 
Transformer Description: This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC),
a novel architectural framework introduced in arXiv:2512.248801.Standard Hyper-Connections (HC) improve the model
performance by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity.

The model is there for the purpose of learning, the core algorithm. It is not meant to be a full-scale model. However core class can easily be adapted to a production-scale model.
